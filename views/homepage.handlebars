        <strong>Cybrus is your trusted password manager</strong> We have way too many accounts out there and most of
        them have, or at least should, have unique and complex passwords.
        That being said, to keep track of all of those accounts and their respective passwords is too much of a hastle,
        and that`s where Cybrus comes in.

            <strong>Never struggle to access your accounts again.</strong> Having to reach the depths of your mind to
            remember an account that is very important to you
            but don`t use that often, having to go back and forth changing your password every time you go back in, the
            password changing link is sent to an email that
            you didn`t remember existed, or even writing your accounts in a piece of paper which is a bad idea in so
            many levels. Wouldn`t it be great to have a safe, fast and reliable way to do that?
